*A collection of R scripts exploring the statistical concept of science-wise false discovery rate (SWFDR) and illustrating software design choices in R. The base script is `swfdr_base.R`, a simple implementation that uses base R capabilities only. [Exercises for the Reader](`r exercises`) offers ideas for improving the program. Other scripts in the distribution extend the base implementation by providing solutions to some of the exercises.*

## Overview
The SWFDR software reimplements the core idea in 
[David Colquhoun's fascinating paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216), "An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values" and further discussed in [Felix Schönbrodt's blog post](http://www.nicebread.de/whats-the-probability-that-a-significant-p-value-indicates-a-true-effect/), "What’s the probability that a significant p-value indicates a true effect?" and related  [ShinyApp](http://shinyapps.org/apps/PPV/). The term *science-wise false discovery rate* is from [Jager and Leek's paper](http://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxt007), "An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature". [John Ioannidis’s landmark paper](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124), “Why most published research findings are false”, is the origin of it all.

The *false discovery rate* (*FDR*) is the probability that a significant p-value indicates a false positive, or equivalently, the proportion of significant p-values that correspond to results without a real effect. The *science-wise false discovery rate* (*SWFDR*) is the probability that a significant p-value in the *published literature* is a false positive, or equivalently, the proportion of published significant results that are wrong. The scripts simulate a large number of problem instances and produce graphs of SWFDR for a range of parameter values. 

## Installation and Usage
The simplest way to get the software is to [download](https://github.com/natgoodman/FDR/archive/master.zip) the repository. You can also clone it using this URL: <https://github.com/natgoodman/FDR.git>.

The software is in the `R` subdirectory. The scripts are

1. `swfdr_base.R`. Simple, base implementation. 
2. `swfdr_plot.R`. Improves the plotting functions in `swfdr_base.R` by consolidating duplicated code.
3. `swfdr_pwr.R`. Produces better graphs than `swfdr_plot.R` when the user varies power directly, rather than indirectly via effect size. 
4. `swfdr_notnorm.R`. Moves beyond normal distributions and the t-test. 
5. `swfdr_interp.R`. Generalizes the interpolation scheme of the previous implementations to produce graphs of SWFDR across any parameters the user varies. This implementation requires the XXX package from CRAN.
6. `swfdr_ggplot.R`. Uses ggplot2 instead of homebrew plotting code. Requires the ggplot2 package from CRAN.

The first four scripts use base R capabilities only and will run "out of the box" on any (reasonably modern) R installation. 

The recommended way to run a script, e.g. `swfdr_base.R`, is to `source` the program into your R session and run the statement `run();`  as shown below. You can also install the software and load it as a library as explained in the [companion document](`r paste(sep='',software,'#installation_and_usage')`)..

``` {r eval=FALSE}
## This code block assumes your working directory is the root of the distribution.

source('R/swfdr_base.R');
run();
```

This runs the program with default parameters producing four graphs similar to the ones below.  The default computation performs $2.5 \times 10^5$ simulations (taking about 3 minutes on my small Linux server).

```{r out.width="50%",echo=FALSE,fig.show='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/swfdr_base/plot_byprop.png');
knitr::include_graphics('figure/swfdr_base/plot_byd.png');
knitr::include_graphics('figure/swfdr_base/plot_vsprop.png');
knitr::include_graphics('figure/swfdr_base/plot_vsd.png');
```

The notation is

-  solid lines show theoretical results; dashed lines are empirical results from the simulation 
-  *fdr*. false discovery rate
-  *pval*. p-value cutoff for significance
-  *prop.true*. proportion of simulated cases that have a real effect
-  *d*. standardized effect size, aka *Cohen's d*

## Bugs and Caveats

Please report any bugs, other problems, and feature requests using the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/natgoodman/SWFDR/issues). I will be notified, and you'll be apprised of progress.

`swfdr_base.R` is pretty basic. See [Exercises for the Reader](`r exercises`) for a list of known limitations, and other scripts in the distribution for solutions to some of these problems.
