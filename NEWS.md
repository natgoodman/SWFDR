Release 1.00 2017-10-16 (not yet released)
------------------------------------------

### Revise documents per comments of external readers

-   As suggested by Daniel Lakens, I added [Sholom Wacholder et al's 2004 paper](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/96/6/434/2606750/) "Assessing the Probability That a Positive Report is False: An Approach for Molecular Epidemiology Studies" as the earliest work on the subject instead of saying that [John Ioannidis’s 2004 paper](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124), “Why most published research findings are false” started it all.
-   Inspired by Will Gervais's comments, I changed "case \#3" in the discussion to explain that this sometimes improves the hypothesis and sometimes not.
-   As suggested by Will Gervais, I added [Paul Smaldino and Richard McElreath's paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/160384) "The natural selection of bad science" to my brief discussion of "Publish or Perish".

### Changes to support public release

-   Update dates in all documents
-   Add 'stable' version of swfdr document as crude workaround for lack of versioning in GitHub Pages and change README accordingly
